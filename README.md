SlidingDrawer
=============

The class android.widget.SlidingDrawer {@link http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/SlidingDrawer.html} was deprecated in API level 17, not supported anymore. I have done my own implementation on the source code for the Android Open Source Project. For now, it have supported all the orientations, which are top-down, bottom-up, left-to-right and right-to-left.
